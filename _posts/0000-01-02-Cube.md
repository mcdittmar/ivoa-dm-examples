Generalities
------------

As for the other examples we provide two representations for the instances. One is expressed in
a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that we are developing along with the VODML-related standards.

The DSL is independent of the serialization format, and allows to describe the instances
in a simpler language without much boilerplate.

We also provide the VOTable serializations of those instances, which is what providers and
clients will need to work with in practice.

Time Series
-----------

### DSL Instance

{% include jovial.md name='time-series' %}

### VOTable serialization
